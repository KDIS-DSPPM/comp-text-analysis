# Introduction to Data Science for Public Policy and Management 

* Instructor: [Jae Yeon Kim](https://jaeyk.github.io/)

What is data science, and how can you apply it to solve social problems? This course is for students with a serious interest in using data-driven approaches to tackle pressing social problems. The course will provide students with a mental framework to think through the critical decisions they need to make in each step of the data science workflow. 

The course is divided into two main sections: fundamentals and applications. As for fundamentals, we will first learn what data science is and what it is not (spoiler: it is not all about big data!) and how to design a data science project. We will then learn the framework of computational social science: combining data science tools and techniques with social science theories and research methods. 

As for applications, we will learn how to answer descriptive, inferential, and predictive questions using administrative, survey, experimental, and digital trace data. Each class session is built around discussions on data science applications to social problems, ranging from detecting poverty to reducing pollution.  

Note that the course is not about learning programming. The emphasis is on navigating various ways of combining data, computing, and social science to solve real-world problems.
